i
really
don
t
see
anything
romantic
in
proposing
it
is
very
romantic
to
be
in
love
but
there
is
nothing
romantic
about
a
definite
proposal
why
one
may
be
accepted
one
usually
is
i
believe
then
the
excitement
is
all
over
the
very
essence
of
romance
is
uncertainty
if
ever
i
get
married
i
ll
certainly
try
to
forget
the
fact
